      <u1>
        <li>2008: The search begins for a new dog. We have 3 children, who at the time were ages 10, 8, and 3 years old. My parents stumble upon an ad for Lab and Doberman mix puppies.</li>
        <li>2008: The family takes the 1 hour car ride to go check out these puppies. They are all rambunctious, except for the one full black puppy who is sitting in the cubby of a desk. We end up choosing this puppy.</li>
        <li>2008: Diesel is taken home and immedietely loves his time with the 3 kids. Playing outside all day on the weekends, and the second the kids get home from school until sun down on the week days.</li>
