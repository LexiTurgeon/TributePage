      <u1 id="bullet-points">
        <li><b>2008:</b> The search begins for a new dog. We have 3 children, who at the time were ages 10, 8, and 3 years old. My parents stumble upon an ad for Lab and Doberman mix puppies.</li>
        <li><b>2008:</b> The family takes the 1 hour car ride to go check out these puppies. They are all rambunctious, except for the one full black puppy who is sitting in the cubby of a desk. We end up choosing this puppy.</li>
        <li><b>2008:</b> Diesel is taken home and immedietely loves his time with the 3 kids. Playing outside all day on the weekends, and the second the kids get home from school until sun down on the week days.</li>
        <li><b>2009:</b> Diesel works on his training to understand what is right and wrong living with his new family. Everyone falls in love with diesel and he has grown to be 100 pounds fully grown.</li>
         <li><b>2010-2017:</b> Diesel gets to explore his whole life. He gets to go on camping trips, countless hikes, and spends as much time with the family as his life deserves.</li>
         <li><b>2017-2018:</b> Diesel starts to slow down in life. The hikes are far and few between, the walks are shorter, the camping trips come to a hault.</li>
        <li><b>2019-2020:</b> As Diesel starts to slow down, he enjoys the last few years of his life at home. His daily walks to the end of the road and basking in the sun on the back deck are his favorite things to do!</li>
